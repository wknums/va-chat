"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create an Azure AI agent that
uses Bing Custom Search to find real-time information from the web.

More information on Bing Custom Search and difference from Bing Grounding can be found here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/bing-custom-search

Prerequisites:
1. A connected Grounding with Bing Custom Search resource in your Azure AI project
2. Set BING_CUSTOM_CONNECTION_ID environment variable
   Example: BING_CUSTOM_CONNECTION_ID="your-bing-custom-connection-id"
3. Set BING_CUSTOM_INSTANCE_NAME environment variable
   Example: BING_CUSTOM_INSTANCE_NAME="your-bing-custom-instance-name"

To set up Bing Custom Search:
1. Go to Azure AI Foundry portal (https://ai.azure.com)
2. Navigate to your project's "Connected resources" section
3. Add a new connection for "Grounding with Bing Custom Search"
4. Copy the connection ID and instance name and set the appropriate environment variables
